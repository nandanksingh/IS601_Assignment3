# Assignment 3 â€“ Command Line Calculator (OOP Version)

## Overview
This project is a Python-based **command-line calculator** developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
The calculator uses a **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)** interface where users can perform arithmetic operations continuously until they choose to exit.  

Key features:
- **Arithmetic operations**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- **Error handling**: detects invalid inputs and prevents division by zero.  
- **Input validation**: ensures correct usage and provides feedback.  
- **Best practices**: follows the **DRY principle** to keep the code clean and maintainable.  
- **Testing**: includes unit tests, parameterized tests, and 100% coverage enforced through GitHub Actions.  


## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd IS601-Fall2025/Assignment3
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies


## Usage Instructions
1. Run the calculator from the terminal: python main.py
2. To run tests: pytest


## Reflection

This assignment helped me apply OOP concepts in a real project.
Using classes and static methods improved the structure of my calculator, making it more modular and reusable. Writing parameterized tests gave me confidence that the code handles different inputs correctly, while GitHub Actions ensured that my work stays reliable through automated testing and coverage checks.

I also learned the importance of clear error handling and user feedback, since a good program should guide the user, not just execute commands. Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of both software design and testing practices, which are essential skills for building professional Python applications.
